## Grading

The final grade for the exercise classes is formed on the basis of a final (group) project after the end of the term. Details to be announced.

## Homework groups

Both the homeworks and the final project are submitted and graded via github classroom. You need a working github.com account
that is linked to your student id. Homeworks and final projects are assigned to teams of up to 5 members. To register a team or to join an existing one, please visit [https://classroom.github.com/a/G9O8bGqo](https://classroom.github.com/a/G9O8bGqo).

## Software

For the exercise classes you need a working installation of both R and R studio desktop (follow the links below). Note that R Studio will not work without R, so please install R first (use the default settings during the installation). If you encounter problems with the installation, please email me or ask me during one of the online meetings.
